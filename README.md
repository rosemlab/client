# Rosem framework monorepo

> This is an ever-evolving, very opinionated architecture and dev environment for new Rosem SPA projects. Questions, feedback, and for now, even bikeshedding are welcome. ðŸ˜„ If you'd like to increase the time I can spend on this project **please consider becoming a [sponsor on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/roshe)**. :pray:

## Features (todo)

- [**Thorough documentation**](#documentation): Written with the same care as Rosem's core docs to quickly train new team members and consolidate knowledge.
- [**Guaranteed consistency**](docs/linting.md): Opinionated linting for SFC, JavaScript/JSON, SCSS, and Markdown, integrated into Visual Studio Code and run against staged files on pre-commit.
- [**First-class tests**](docs/tests.md): Practice test-driven development with both unit and end-to-end tests. Unit tests with Jest live as first-class citizens alongside your source files, while Cypress provides reliable end-to-end tests in an intuitive GUI for development.
- [**Speedy development**](docs/development.md): Between [configurable generators](docs/development.md#generators), [handy aliases](docs/development.md#aliases), and [global base components](docs/development.md#base-components), your productivity will skyrocket.

## Getting started

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/rosemlabs/skeleton.git my-new-project

# 2. Enter your newly-cloned folder
cd my-new-project

# 3. Replace this README's CI badge with a note about when you started
# and a link to a compare URL, so that you can always get an overview
# of new features added to the skeleton since you cloned.
node _start.js

# 4. Delete the start script, as there can be only one beginning.
rm _start.js

# 5. Read the documentation linked below for "Setup and development".
```
